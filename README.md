**🌐 [itoonx.github.io/Auralis](https://itoonx.github.io/Auralis/)** — the landing page: what auralis
does, the measured proof, and a replay of a real fleet run.

**The coordination layer for fleets of AI coding agents — a shared, persistent brain and real-time
coordination that make many agents work as one team instead of many amnesiacs.**

Point auralis at a repository and a *society* of agents **analyses** it together; point it at an empty
folder and they **build** one — the same coordination either way.

> **The bet:** when you run *many* agents on one codebase, the model isn't the bottleneck — the shared
> state is. (Our own timing proves it: the LLM call is 99.9% of wall-clock; the platform adds ~0.05%.)

## What it gives you

| | In one line | Deep dive |
|---|---|---|
| **A living memory** | not storage — a full lifecycle: recall by meaning + knowledge graph, ranking by *earned* trust and citations, **time-travel recall** (`as_of` — what was true *then*), graceful forgetting, and a **sleep job** that tidies contradictions while you're away | [platform](docs/platform.md#1--the-shared-brain-oracle-lite) · [research](docs/research-memory-os.md) |
| **Coordination** | agents plan, share live mid-task, and are *prevented* — not advised — from duplicating or clobbering work | [platform](docs/platform.md#2--coordination-the-society) |
| **Build mode** | the fleet writes real programs — one file per worker, interfaces agreed via the brain, verified by an independent harness, reworked on failure | [platform](docs/platform.md#build-mode--the-fleet-writes-code) |
| **Session memory, both ways** | your Claude Code session feeds the same brain the fleet uses — what you say becomes recallable by workers, what the fleet learns surfaces back in your prompts, and every exchange lands on a replayable timeline | [mcp](docs/mcp.md) |
| **Runtime-agnostic** | policy lives in the middle layer; swap Claude for any model/agent without touching coordination | [platform](docs/platform.md#3--runtime-agnostic-any-model-any-agent) |
| **Observability** | every step of every run — plans, tool calls, verdicts, reworks — timed, narrated, and replayable in a live dashboard (studio) | [platform](docs/platform.md#4--observability-find-the-real-bottleneck) |

Every capability above was **measured on live runs, not asserted** — a few headlines:
redundant work **−53%** · duplicate work *prevented*, not advised (`prevented-dupes=4`) · real multi-file
programs built and verified first-try (REST API, expression evaluator) · ranking A/B: plain **25% → 75%**
precision@1 · asked "what was the timeout *in March*?" and got March's answer (`as_of`) · the sleep job
caught a real 10min→30min contradiction, judged it, and retired the stale fact **with the reason recorded**
· the brain **defends its own memory** (bad writes rejected at the gate). Full results:

## Architecture

```
             mozaik · one shared event bus (the society)
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │   Planner → Conductor → Worker ×N (any agent runtime)     │
   │   MemoryLibrarian · Sentry · Critic · Auditor             │
   └───────────┬───────────────────────────────┬──────────────┘
    learn · search · relate (HTTP / MCP)        │  claim (HTTP) — deterministic dedup
   ┌───────────▼───────────────────────────────▼──────────────┐
   │  oracle-lite · the brain + the middle layer               │
   │  Bun + SQLite FTS5 · LanceDB vectors                      │
   │  persistent · append-only (no delete)                    │
   │  semantic recall · distillation · graph · claim registry  │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Left arrow = **memory** (what agents know) · right arrow = **policy** (who's doing what). Both central,
so every process, model, and machine shares them.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** a running Docker daemon — that's it for the platform. (For the fleet/MCP tools:
Node 20+ · pnpm · **Claude Code logged in** — workers reuse your login, no API key needed.)

**1 · Install & start — one command, everything in Docker** *(auth, semantic recall, dashboard — all
automated and idempotent; full walkthrough: [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md))*

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd auralis
./install.sh                      # studio → http://localhost:47780 · brain API → :47778
```

**2 · Analyse any repo**

```bash
AURALIS_PROJECT=myrepo AURALIS_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/repo pnpm analyze "how does auth work?"
```

**3 · Build a small program** *(workers own one file each; auralis verifies, reworks on FAIL)*

```bash
AURALIS_MODE=build AURALIS_ACCEPT=restapi AURALIS_PROJECT_DIR=./my-app \
AURALIS_GOAL="a todo REST API over Node's http: store.js, router.js, server.js" pnpm dev
```

**4 · Or drive it from Claude Code** — add the MCP server and your session gets `analyze`/`build` tools;
inside this repo your session is also captured into the same brain: **[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md)**

**5 · Watch it work** — open the studio during a run: live timeline (▸ ✓ ⇄ ↻), run scorecards, the graph.
